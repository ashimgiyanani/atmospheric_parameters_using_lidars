#Script for DEWA lidar project to evaluate the following objectives
# -   operational concept of a lidar syste, for a wind alarm
# -   device suitability
# -	Verification of the alarm strategy, considering tracker time to stow, to advise on its effectiveness as an early alert system
# -	Assessment of false alarm risk based on the documentation of the system and FhG experience and own data sources.
# -	Potential alternatives to a LIDAR based solution. 
# -	The assessment will be based on the documentation of the system which should include a description on the complete system (LIDAR radar, software for data processing, and link to SCADA and tracker control system)

# measure the amount of force of the wind on the solar panels based on these simplifications

# no weather stations data available, maybe over openweatherdata.org
# 30 sec approximately for stowing
